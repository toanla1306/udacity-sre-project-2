### Descriptions
More detailed descriptions of each asset identified above.
- EC2 instane: An Amazon EC2 instance is a virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure.
- VPC: Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.
- EKS Node Groups: With Amazon EKS managed node groups, you donâ€™t need to separately provision or register the Amazon EC2 instances that provide compute capacity to run your Kubernetes applications. You can create, automatically update, or terminate nodes for your cluster with a single operation.
- Key Pairs: A key pair, consisting of a public key and a private key, is a set of security credentials that you use to prove your identity when connecting to an Amazon EC2 instance. Amazon EC2 stores the public key on your instance, and you store the private key.
- AWS AMI images: An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a supported and maintained image provided by AWS that provides the information required to launch an instance. You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance. You can launch multiple instances from a single AMI when you require multiple instances with the same configuration.
- Elastic Load Balancers: Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones. It monitors the health of its registered targets, and routes traffic only to the healthy targets. Elastic Load Balancing scales your load balancer capacity automatically in response to changes in incoming traffic.
## DR Plan
### Pre-Steps:
List steps you would perform to setup the infrastructure in the other region. It doesn't have to be super detailed, but high-level should suffice.
1. Setting zone1 and zone2 are configured the same.
2. Using infrastructure as code to deploy.
3. Make sure the infrastructure is set up and working in the DR site.

## Steps:
You won't actually perform these steps, but write out what you would do to "fail-over" your application and database cluster to the other region. Think about all the pieces that were setup and how you would use those in the other region
- Step 1: Create a cloud load balancer and point DNS to the load balancer. This way you can have multiple instances behind 1 IP in a region. During a failover scenario, you would fail over the single DNS entry at your DNS provider to point to the DR site. This is much more intelligent than pointing to a single instance of a web server.
- Step 2: Have a replicated database and perform a failover on the database. While a backup is good and necessary, it is time-consuming to restore from backup. In this DR step, you would have already configured replication and would perform the database failover. Ideally, your application would be using a generic CNAME DNS record and would just connect to the DR instance of the database.
